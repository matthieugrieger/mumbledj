* Fixed a bug in which a duration of 0:00 was shown for songs that were less than a minute long.

### April 17, 2015 -- `v2.7.0`
* Migrated all YouTube API calls to YouTube Data API v3. This means that you **MUST** follow the instructions in the following link if you were using a previous version of MumbleDJ: https://github.com/matthieugrieger/mumbledj#youtube-api-keys.
* Made the SongQueue much more flexible. These changes will allow easy addition of support for other music services.

* Fixed a crash that would occur when the last song of a playlist was skipped.

### March 27, 2015 -- `v2.6.9`
* Fixed a race condition that would sometimes cause the bot to crash (thanks [dylanetaft](https://github.com/dylanetaft)!).

### March 26, 2015 -- `v2.6.8`
* Renamed `mumbledj.gcfg` to `config.gcfg`. However, please note that it will still be called `mumbledj.gcfg` in your `~/.mumbledj` directory. Hopefully this will avoid any ambiguity when referring to the
config files.
* Tweaked the `Makefile` to handle situations where `go build` creates an executable with an appended version number.

### March 20, 2015 -- `v2.6.7`
* Fixed a typo in `mumbledj.gcfg`.

* Added missing AdminSkipPlaylistAlias option to `mumbledj.gcfg`.

### February 25, 2015 -- `v2.6.5`

* Fixed failed audio downloads for YouTube videos with IDs beginning with "-".

### February 19, 2015 -- `v2.6.3`
