## COMMANDS
These are all of the chat commands currently supported by MumbleDJ. All command names and command prefixes may be changed in `~/.mumbledj/config/mumbledj.gcfg`.

Command | Description | Arguments | Admin | Example
--------|-------------|-----------|-------|--------
**add** | Adds audio from a url to the song queue. If no songs are currently in the queue, the audio will begin playing immediately. Playlists may also be added using this command. Please note, however, that if a YouTube playlist contains over 25 videos only the first 25 videos will be placed in the song queue. | youtube_video_url OR youtube_playlist_url OR soundcloud_track_url OR soundcloud_playlist_url | No | `!add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xfEr2Oxdys`
**skip**| Submits a vote to skip the current song. Once the skip ratio target (specified in `mumbledj.gcfg`) is met, the song will be skipped and the next will start playing. Each user may only submit one skip per song. | None | No | `!skip`
**skipplaylist** | Submits a vote to skip the current playlist. Once the skip ratio target (specified in mumbledj.gcfg) is met, the playlist will be skipped and the next song/playlist will start playing. Each user may only submit one skip per playlist. | None | No | `!skipplaylist`
**forceskip** | An admin command that forces a song skip. | None | Yes | `!forceskip`
**forceskipplaylist** | An admin command that forces a playlist skip. | None | Yes | `!forceskipplaylist`
**help** | Displays this list of commands in Mumble chat. | None | No | `!help`
**volume** | Either outputs the current volume or changes the current volume. If desired volume is not provided, the current volume will be displayed in chat. Otherwise, the volume for the bot will be changed to desired volume if it is within the allowed volume range. | None OR desired volume | No | `!volume 0.5`, `!volume`
**move** | Moves MumbleDJ into channel if it exists. | Channel | Yes | `!move Music`
**reload** | Reloads `mumbledj.gcfg` to retrieve updated configuration settings. | None | Yes | `!reload`
**reset** | Stops all audio and resets the song queue. | None | Yes | `!reset`
**numsongs** | Outputs the number of songs in the queue in chat. Individual songs and songs within playlists are both counted. | None | No | `!numsongs`

**numcached** | Outputs the number of songs currently cached on disk. | None | Yes | `!numcached`
**cachesize** | Outputs the total file size of the cache in MB. | None | Yes | `!cachesize`
**kill** | Safely cleans the bot environment and disconnects from the server. Please use this command to stop the bot instead of force closing, as the kill command deletes any remaining songs in the `~/.mumbledj/songs` directory. | None | Yes | `!kill`




## INSTALLATION

###YOUTUBE API KEYS
Effective April 20th, 2015, all requests to YouTube's API must use v3 of their API. Unfortunately, this means that all those who install an instance of the bot on their server must create their own API key to use with the bot. Below is a guide of the steps you must take to get proper YouTube support.

**Important:** MumbleDJ will simply not work anymore if you do not follow these steps and create a YouTube API key.

**1)** Navigate to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and sign in to your Google account or create one if you haven't already.

**2)** Click the "Create Project" button and give your project a name. It doesn't matter what you set your project name to. Once you have a name click the "Create" button. You should be redirected to your new project once it's ready.

**3)** Click on "APIs & auth" on the sidebar, and then click APIs. Under the "YouTube APIs" header, click "YouTube Data API". Click on the "Enable API" button.

**4)** Click on the "Credentials" option underneath "APIs & auth" on the sidebar. Underneath "Public API access" click on "Create new Key". Click the "Server key" option.

**5)** Add the IP address of the machine MumbleDJ will run on in the box that appears. Click "Create".

**6)** You should now see that an API key has been generated. Copy it.

**7)** Open up `~/.bashrc` with your favorite text editor (or `~/.zshrc` if you use `zsh`). Add the following line to the bottom: `export YOUTUBE_API_KEY="<your_key_here>"`. Replace \<your_key_here\> with your API key.

**8)** Close your current terminal window and open another one up. You should be able to use Youtube on MumbleDJ now!

###SOUNDCLOUD API KEYS
A soundcloud API key is required for soundcloud integration. If no soundcloud api key is found, then the service will be disabled (youtube links will still work however).

**1)** Login/signup for a soundcloud account on [https://soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com) 

**2)** Now to get the API key create a new app here: [http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new](http://soundcloud.com/you/apps/new)

**3)** Copy the Client ID (not the Client Secret)

**4)** Open up `~/.bashrc` with your favorite text editor (or `~/.zshrc` if you use `zsh`). Add the following line to the bottom: `export SOUNDCLOUD_API_KEY="<your_key_here>"`. Replace \<your_key_here\> with your API key.

**5)** Close your current terminal window and open another one up. You should be able to use soundcloud on MumbleDJ now!

###SETUP GUIDE  
**1)** Install and correctly configure [`Go`](https://golang.org/) (1.4 or higher). Specifically, make sure to follow [this guide](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) and set the `GOPATH` environment variable properly.

**2)** Install [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and [`mercurial`](http://mercurial.selenic.com/) if they are not already installed on your system. Also be sure that you have
[`opus`](http://www.opus-codec.org/) and its development headers installed on your system, as well as `openal` (check your distributions repo for the package name).

**3)** Install [`youtube-dl`](https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl#installation). It is recommended to install `youtube-dl` through the method described on the linked GitHub page, rather than installing through a distribution repository. This ensures that you get the most up-to-date version of `youtube-dl`.

**4)** If you wish to install MumbleDJ without any further root privileges, make sure that `~/bin` exists and is added to your `$PATH`. If this step is not done, the `Makefile` will place the MumbleDJ binary in `/usr/local/bin` instead, which requires root privileges.

**5)** Clone the `MumbleDJ` repository or [download the latest release](https://github.com/matthieugrieger/mumbledj/releases).

**6)** `cd` into the `MumbleDJ` repository directory and execute the following commands:
```
$ make
$ make install
```

**7)** Edit `~/.mumbledj/config/mumbledj.gcfg` to your liking. This file will be overwritten if the config file structure is changed in a commit, but a backup is always stored at
`~/.mumbledj/config/mumbledj_backup.gcfg`.

**8)** Execute the command shown at the top of this `README` document with your credentials, and the bot should be up and running!

**Recommended, but not required:** Set `opusthreshold=0` in `/etc/mumble-server.ini` or `/etc/murmur.ini`. This will force the server to always use the Opus audio codec, which is the only codec that MumbleDJ supports.

###UPDATE GUIDE
**1)** `git pull` or [download the latest release](https://github.com/matthieugrieger/mumbledj/releases).

**2)** Issue the following commands within your updated MumbleDJ directory:
```
$ make clean
$ make
$ make install
```
**NOTE**: It is *very* important that you use `make` instead of `make build` when updating MumbleDJ as the first option will grab the latest updates from MumbleDJ's dependencies.

**3)** Check to make sure your configuration in `~/.mumbledj/config/mumbledj.gcfg` is the same as before. If it is back to the default, a backup should have been created at `~/.mumbledj/config/mumbledj_backup.gcfg` so you can copy the values back over.

## TROUBLESHOOTING
**YouTube videos downloads work when using `youtube-dl` but not within MumbleDJ.**

This is likely related to how you set up your Google account for the YouTube API. Specifically, make sure you you try using an IPv4 server address in the list of allowed IPs if you were using IPv6 previously.

**Whenever the `!add` command is used I receive the following message in chat: "The audio download for this video failed. YouTube has likely not generated the audio files for this video yet. Skipping to the next song!"**

First, make sure you have `youtube-dl` installed and it is the latest version. MumbleDJ makes use of `youtube-dl`'s `--` commandline argument which is not supported in older versions.

If this doesn't fix the issue, try the following fix from [@MrKrucible](https://github.com/MrKrucible):

>I fixed it by following the instructions here to set default arguments: https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#configuration

>For the lazy...
>- 1. First make ```~/.config/youtube-dl/``` and create a file named ```config```.
>- 2. Then put ```--force-ipv4``` into the config. Nothing else needs to be in there unless you want to add more arguments.

**I receive the following error when compiling MumbleDJ: "undefined: tls.DialWithDialer"**

This issue is caused by having an outdated version of Go. Make sure you are using the latest available version of Go.

**I can't get MumbleDJ to compile correctly under `gccgo`**

Unfortunately MumbleDJ likely will not work with `gccgo`. MumbleDJ is developed and tested on vanilla Go.

**I receive the following message when compiling MumbleDJ: "local.h:6:19: error: AL/alc.h: No such file or directory"**

Don't worry about it. The compilation went through successfully, OpenAL is not needed by the bot.

**I receive the following message when building MumbleDJ: "cannot create \<nil\>/go.o: No such file or directory"**

Execute the following before building:

```export TMPDIR=/tmp```
